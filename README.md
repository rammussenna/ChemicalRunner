# Chemical Runner – Story Overview

## Premise

Chemical Runner is set in the year 2190 in a city entirely dependent on chemical infrastructure for survival. The city is controlled by powerful factions, including the Four Saints, the Inquisitors, and the Underground/Cartel. Players take on the role of a protagonist who was once a high-ranking operative in a major technocratic faction called **The Meridian Assembly**.

During an operation that exposed his radical plan to free the world from chemical dependency, he was overthrown, captured, and nearly executed. The 4 Saints, recognizing his potential, orchestrated a covert rescue through a sub-faction called **The Riders**. During the escape, he was shot in the head and injected with **Gastroam**, a compound that suspended his death but erased his memories.

Years later, he is revived under controlled conditions, reliant on **Larkindan**, a chemical necessary for keeping his body and mind functional.

The story revolves around the protagonist rediscovering his identity, mastering his chemical-dependent powers, and navigating the complex web of faction politics to decide the city’s future.

* **Dependency vs Autonomy:** Chemicals like Larkindan sustain the protagonist but also bind him to the factions.
* **Power and Betrayal:** His past exploits and strength made him both a legend and a target.
* **Moral Ambiguity:** Players choose how to act based on fragmented memories and factional pressures.
