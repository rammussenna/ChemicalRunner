# Chemical Runner – The 4 Saints Faction Design

## Core Concept

* **Number:** 4 dominant factions ("The 4 Saints")
* **Industry:** Corrosive chemicals and chemical commerce
* **Goal:** Control the city’s chemical economy
* **Player Role:** Outsider or rising force who can ally, manipulate, or overthrow factions

**Faction Mechanics:**

1. **Faction Reputation** – numeric value, rises/falls with missions, purchases, sabotage, or killing leaders
2. **Access Level** – unlocks faction-specific chemicals, mutagens, missions
3. **Dynamic World Impact** – city reacts to player’s alignment: rival patrols, supply scarcity, and environmental hazards

## Individual Factions

### 1️⃣ Saint Ignatius – The Firebrand

* **Theme:** Aggression and domination; fiery chemicals
* **Personality:** Militaristic, authoritarian, flamboyant
* **Gameplay Buffs:** Strongest oxidants, fire-based explosions more powerful
* **Debuffs:** Volatility risk is very high, instability meter increases faster with repeated chemical use
* **Flavor:** Known for "street purges" to maintain territory
* **Endgame Impact:** Taking over grants access to unstable high-damage explosives

### 2️⃣ Saint Benedict – The Keeper

* **Theme:** Stability, control, and preservation
* **Personality:** Methodical, patient, religiously strict
* **Gameplay Buffs:** Corrosives last longer, precise targeting, chemical stability bonuses
* **Debuffs:** Attack potency is slightly lower, production of high-risk chemicals is slower
* **Flavor:** Controls laboratories and research facilities
* **Endgame Impact:** Taking over unlocks chemical formulas that reduce mutation risk

### 3️⃣ Saint Theresa – The Medic

* **Theme:** Healing and recovery; defensive chemistry
* **Personality:** Charitable facade, pragmatic underworld tactician
* **Gameplay Buffs:** Recovery serums and antidotes are stronger, minor regeneration during runs
* **Debuffs:** Offensive chemicals weaker, volatile reactions less potent
* **Flavor:** Controls clinics, neutralizing toxic zones, and curative chemical networks
* **Endgame Impact:** Taking over gives self-sustain mutations and enhanced healing chemicals

### 4️⃣ Saint Dominic – The Courier

* **Theme:** Speed, delivery, and rapid chemical production
* **Personality:** Fast-talking, opportunistic, street-smart
* **Gameplay Buffs:** Movement speed increased, chemical pickups more abundant, real-time mixing slightly faster
* **Debuffs:** Chemicals degrade faster, short-lived effect durations
* **Flavor:** Controls distribution networks and smuggling routes
* **Endgame Impact:** Taking over allows faster production chains and rare chemical variants

## Faction Relationships

* Each faction has rivalries and alliances. Player actions affect world tension.
* **Dynamic Example:**

  * Ally with Saint Ignatius → Benedict sees you as threat, patrols increase in their zones
  * Kill Saint Theresa → Dominic may offer secret deals or betray later depending on player choices

---

## Player-Faction Interaction

1. **Ally** – Access faction-specific bonuses and missions; can buy rare chemicals
2. **Neutral/Independent** – Avoid factions or do contracts for all; smaller bonuses but freedom
3. **Sabotage/Takeover** – Destroy faction reputation, eliminate leader, inherit assets; increases difficulty and instability

* Reputation is **numeric + narrative**: e.g., "High Benedict favor, moderate Dominic distrust, Ignatius hates you"
* Missions unlock based on your standing with each faction

## Faction Progression – Endgame Impact

* Faction control changes chemical economy:

  * Availability of rare compounds
  * Enemy composition and strength
  * Mutation probabilities and chemical instability rates
* **Multiple Endings:**

  * Ally with all → stable, high-access endgame
  * Kill all → chaotic, powerful but high-risk endgame
  * Mix alliances → narrative branching with faction-specific bosses
